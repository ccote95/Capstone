### Problem Solved

---

Magic the Gathering is a fun trading card game that requires 2 - 4 people to play depending on the format.
Thats where MtgConnect comes into play, with this application you will be able to create a profile and start looking for groups to play with.
Within each post you will see the type of format someone is looking to play and their deck that they are trying to use.
You will be able to interact with each post by leaving comments if you would like to play or not.
